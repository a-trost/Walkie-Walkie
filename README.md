## Hallway Requests
This is a React app made for a local elementary school. Download the repo, run `npm start` to run the server and open index.html to run it.

## Use Case
My elementary school has only two bathrooms, and they're on opposite ends of the building. The students are too young to walk themselves to the bathroom and nurse, so we have a hallway monitor come and pick them up.

The process for calling for the hallway monitor is time consuming and imperfect, with requests being lost and never responded to.

This is my solution to the problem, something that keeps a list for the monitor and allows teachers to request a bathroom while still teaching.
